    This background is most useful when it is somehow possible to measure the background without the resonator
    present, possibly by changing the temperature or applying a magnetic field. In the shunt case, this procedure
    should work well and no correction should be necessary. In the reflection case, even if the resonance frequency
    can be shifted by many linewidths, the pi phase shift due to the reflection will still be present,
    so the measured background data should be multiplied by -1 before being passed to this class. In the transmission
    case, the background could be measured either using switches to bypass the resonator or during a separate
